# Custom PCB Fabrication
The LumenLab PCB was designed using KiCad 9.0.2 with the capabilities of PCBWay in mind. You can adjust to have this manufactured anywhere you want, but be aware that you would need to account for the capabilities of that board house as well.

# Bill of Materials
Still to be finalized, however you can [view the tentative list of components here](./bom/ibom.html).

# PCB Layout
Still to be finalized. Components were placed but still need to be routed and/or have copper pour areas defined.
